# Restaurant-schema

This is an example of how a restaurant would handle customer orders and deliveries using a tech based approach.

The schema includes tables for customers, restaurants, orders, delivery persons and order deliveries. 

The customers table stores information about the customers who place orders. 

The restaurants table stores information about the restaurants that receive orders.

The orders table stores information about the orders placed by customers. 

The delivery persons table stores information about the delivery persons who deliver the orders. 

The order_delivery table stores information about the deliveries made for each order.

All it needs is  a population of customer info and orders.
